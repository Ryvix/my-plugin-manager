## Download and Usage

The easiest way to incorporate your new plugin manager into your WordPress theme or plugin is to generate a custom instance for your project at:

http://mypluginmanager.com#download

After you've submitted the form, your plugin manager download will start and you'll be shown instructions specific to your project to get started.

### Why use the online generator?

Our goal is to provide you with a drop-in script that complies as closely to WordPress coding standards and best practices, as possible. With this in mind, the online generator will:

* Prefix all PHP class names to match your theme or plugin name.
* Name all class files to correctly correspond to the name of those PHP classes.
* Insert your unique namespacing key for anything submitted to the database.
* Insert the localization text domain that matches your theme or plugin.
* If the "plugin" usage type is selected, `add_theme_page()` will be substituted for `add_submenu_page()` (not allowed in themes).
* Give you an example code snippet to get started, which is customized to your project.
