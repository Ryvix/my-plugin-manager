# From the Source

While the plugin manager contained in this directory can be dropped in and tested directly with WordPress, it is not meant for public release. We want you to make my plugin manager into your plugin manager, and make it unique to your product.

The class names, file names, text domain, and other unique identifiers here are setup in a way that are meant to be overridden when the final drop-in script is generated.

To generate your own plugin manager you can use this repository and change the information in the `gulpfile.js`.

Or, you can just use our online generator:
